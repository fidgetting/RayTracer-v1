This is a simple ray tracer that was written for a graphics class I took in the
fall of 2010. I have released it in hopes that I may point to it and say "look
what I did, isn't it cool." I would like to apologize for the messiness of some
of the code, the class was rather intense and I have not been able to clean up
all of the truly bad code that was included.

Since the end of the class, I have changed it to animate the rendering process
in real time, and render on multiple cores. As this is entirely written without
any hardware acceleration, the rendering process is quite slow for more complex
images, the concurrency helped with this some. That and I enjoyed developing the
parallelization.

My graphics class also used a very simplified object file format. Because of
this I have included a few object files that I think produce pretty pictures.
The files are fairly self explanatory, so if your interested in making a new
image I leave it to the user to figure out how. I do have a uncompleted version
that can handle .obj files that I will be finishing this semester.

The only current dependency is opencv. This was used as it has a very simple gui
to display the pictures in the library and an easy method for saving images to
a better file format than ppm.
